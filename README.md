## About

**Dynamic React Component Builder** is a work-in-progress project using **React**, **Node.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. This tool allows users to dynamically generate reusable React components and their corresponding source code.

### Current Features

The project currently supports building some of the most common components required for web applications. These include:

- **Form Builder**:
  - Text input (single-line and multi-line)
  - Email and password fields
  - Checkbox (single and multi-dimensional)
  - Dropdowns
  - Date and time pickers
  - Single and multi-select fields
- **Tab Builder**:
  - Tabs with customizable content
- **Navigation Builder**:
  - Navbars with links and navigation options
- **Table Builder**:
  - Rows, columns
  - Search filters
  - Pagination

### Scalability

The components generated are highly scalable. Additional parameters can be added and passed to extend functionality, such as:

- Adding **module permissions** for navigation items or tabs
- Customizing **validation rules** for form fields

### Future Plans

The following features are planned for future iterations:

- **Custom Component Builders**:
  - Cards
  - Banners
- **Advanced Tools**:
  - Page Builder
  - Template Builder

|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Centralized Component Control** | - Ensures consistent UI/UX across dynamically generated components.<br>- Simplifies maintenance by propagating updates to all components automatically.<br>- Reduces code redundancy with reusable component blocks. | - Initial setup may be time-consuming.<br>- Over-customization may complicate or hinder flexibility. |
| **Scalability & Adaptability**   | - Supports easy customization (e.g., adding fields, filters, columns) to meet growing project requirements.<br>- Future-proof design reduces the impact of changes.                   | - Potential performance issues with unoptimized components.<br>- Requires careful management of dependencies for large-scale projects. |
| **Developer Productivity**       | - Automates the creation of common UI components (e.g., forms, tables), accelerating development.<br>- Speeds up iteration and deployment of features.<br>- Simplifies complex tasks, such as implementing role-based permissions. | - Steep learning curve for new developers.<br>- Developers may face challenges if unfamiliar with the tool.                                           |
| **Self-Healing Solutions**       | - Reduces rework by automating common patterns and handling evolving requirements.<br>- Improves app stability by minimizing manual intervention in component changes.                                                    | - May not be suited for smaller, static projects with limited needs.                                                       |
| **Target Audience**              | - Well-suited for development teams focused on scalability and long-term project growth.<br>- Flexible enough for evolving project requirements.                                     | - May feel excessive for smaller teams or projects with minimal requirements.      |
