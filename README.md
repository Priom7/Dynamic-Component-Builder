## About

**Dynamic React Component Builder** is a work-in-progress project using **React**, **Node.js**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**. This tool allows users to dynamically generate reusable React components and their corresponding source code.

### Current Features

The project currently supports building some of the most common components required for web applications. These include:

- **Form Builder**:
  - Text input (single-line and multi-line)
  - Email and password fields
  - Checkbox (single and multi-dimensional)
  - Dropdowns
  - Date and time pickers
  - Single and multi-select fields
- **Tab Builder**:
  - Tabs with customizable content
- **Navigation Builder**:
  - Navbars with links and navigation options
- **Table Builder**:
  - Rows, columns
  - Search filters
  - Pagination

### Scalability

The components generated are highly scalable. Additional parameters can be added and passed to extend functionality, such as:

- Adding **module permissions** for navigation items or tabs
- Customizing **validation rules** for form fields

### Future Plans

The following features are planned for future iterations:

- **Custom Component Builders**:
  - Cards
  - Banners
- **Advanced Tools**:
  - Page Builder
  - Template Builder
